His research focuses on identifying factors that contribute to adverse outcomes among vulnerable populations, such as infants and pregnant women. His empirical studies examine various environmental factors affecting maternal and infant health, including power plant emissions, pollution (air, noise, light, and water), as well as factors like long commutes and working during pregnancy.

Furthermore, his research extends to investigating causal relationships that carry significant policy implications. Subjects of his empirical studies include, for example, peer effects in physicians' prescription behaviors regarding new drugs, the impact of publicly reported provider quality information on the CABG market, effects of exposure to food advertising on purchasing behaviors, the roles of nationality and ethnicity in shaping international and inter-regional trade, effects of signaling behaviors on college admissions, effects of paid maternity leave on breastfeeding practices, and the mental health implications of the constitutional right to abortion.
